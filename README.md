# Hi I am Nadir Ahmed! 
â€¢ Iâ€™m a Software Developer with a strong focus on frontend development. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and  bringing creative ideas to life through code. With a   Bachelorâ€™s degree in IT and a Diploma in Software Development, Iâ€™m confident that I can be a valuable addition to your team.

â€¢ As part of my academic journey, I completed a final thesis project on an Airline Management System, for which I earned a first-class grade. The project was built using HTML,   CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

â€¢ To further sharpen my skills, I also participated in a coding bootcamp, where I worked on real-world projects using React.js, TypeScript, AJAX, and Supabase.

â€¢ You can check out my projects on GitHub.
